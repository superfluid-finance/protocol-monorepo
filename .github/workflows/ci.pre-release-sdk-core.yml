  # A. ensure subgraph indexing is complete on all v1 endpoints before allowing sdk-core release
  # purpose: ensure the new sdk-core version can be released, it will ALWAYS fail if v1 is
  #          still indexing on any network
  # assumption: releasing sdk-core before v1 is indexed on all networks may lead to a broken release
  #             and we usually release subgraph before sdk-core so we assume subgraph is properly deployed
  # result: this should work once the v1 endpoints are fully indexed, otherwise it will ALWAYS fail and is NG for release

  # B. build and test v1 endpoint subgraph with release sdk-core
  # purpose: ensure the new sdk-core version works with the currently deployed v1 matic endpoint
  # assumption: matic is the indexing blocker and if this passes, it will pass on all other networks
  # result: this should work once matic v1 endpoint is indexed and thus A should be passing as well
  #         otherwise it's NG for release (we run A just in case another endpoint is lagging)

  # C. build and test dev endpoint subgraph with release sdk-core
  # purpose: ensure the new sdk-core version works with the currently deployed dev goerli endpoint
  # assumption: we assume that dev endpoint is synced (do a manual check here to see this is true)
  # result: this should work as ci.canary should've passed otherwise we need to go back and complete the previous release
