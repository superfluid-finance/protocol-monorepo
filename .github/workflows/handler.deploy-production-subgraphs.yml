# Handler Workflow Summary
# This handler workflow file can be used to deploy our production subgraphs.
# It will deploy to all networks on both the Hosted Service and Satsuma.
# This takes a satsuma_version_label and will set it for all networks on Satsuma.
# When we add a new hosted solution (self-hosted, graph studio), we should create a
# new call.deploy-<solution>-subgraph.yml file and add it here.
