# Example SuperApps

The examples contained in this section attempt to cover building with Superfluid

They should give you an idea of what can be built, as well as a general idea of how the SuperApp framework works.

> The example code is unaudited, mostly untested, and only barely works. **Don't use it in production!!**

We are in the process of migrating them to the final version of the superfluid contracts
