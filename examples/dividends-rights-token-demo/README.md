Dividend Rights Token
=====================

A ERC20 token that tokenizes units in the [Instant Distribution Agreements](https://docs.superfluid.finance/tutorials/instant-distribution/).

All holders of the rights tokens can receive cash token rewards in one distribution transaction in two ways:

- If the subscription to the token is approved by its holder, then the distribution is available the moment distribution is done,
- if not, then the pending distribution could be claimed by its holder any time in a separated transaction.

**NB! STILL WORK IN PROGRESS**
