# Superfluid NFT Billboard 

Learn how to insert and make use of additional metadata within your super agreements.

In this tutorial, you'll use Superfluid UserData to pay to post a message on an NFT billboard. We'll use scaffold-eth, hardhat, and react to get the job done ⛏

Note: this code has not been audited and is for example purposes only. 

We're excited to see what you build 💻

### Usage

1) Go get some test DAIx tokens at app.superfluid.finance on Mumbai testnet.
2) Add your own private key, public address and rpc URL for Mumbai inside of a ```.env``` file using the format in ```packages/hardhat/env.example```
3) Deploy Your Billboard NFT by following the instructions below.
4) Add your own custom message inside of each of the scripts as the value that is encoded and set to the ```userData``` variable.



### For Initial Setup and Contract Deployment:

- You need to change the `defaultNetwork` inside of `hardhat.config.js` to reflect your target network.
- If you're deploying locally, `ganache` or `localhost` should suffice. 
- If you're deploying to a live mainnet or testnet, you should change the default network and make sure that your private key and rpc url for that network are correct in your `.env` file.
- Inside of the deploy script, you will also need to add the address of the `host`, `cfa`, and super token you plan to use at the top of the file prior to deployment.

Once the above is complete, you can run:
```yarn install```
```yarn deploy```

To run the react app:
```yarn start```

To create flows and set an initial message:
```yarn createFlow```

To update flows and change the message:
```yarn updateFlow```

To delete flows:
```yarn deleteFlow```

To read data and see userData logged in the console:
```yarn readData```


NOTE: be careful with your private keys! Do not publish them to github. 



# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
