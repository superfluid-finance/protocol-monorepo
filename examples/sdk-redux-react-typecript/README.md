Hi! Welcome to the example project which demonstrated the capabilities of SDK-Redux & SDK-Core.

If it's your first time in the monorepo, go to the root directory and run `yarn first-time-after-git-clone`.
It should install all the required packages, create symlinks between Superfluid packages/projects and build all of them.
After that, you should be able to start this project.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
