# The file .env is parsed by truffle when parsing truffle-config.js.
# You can also provide env vars on the cmdline, they take precedence over values in .env.

# For every network you want to use, set the relevant variables

# Web3 provider URL - can be an https or websocket RPC
# <NETWORK_NAME>_PROVIDER_URL=...
# Mnemonic of the account to be used
# <NETWORK_NAME>_MNEMONIC=...
# Optional: fixed gas price in wei. If not set, the RPC provided value is used.
# <NETWORK_NAME>_GAS_PRICE

# Example for the GÃ¶rli Ethereum testnet:
ETH_GOERLI_PROVIDER_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>
ETH_GOERLI_MNEMONIC="rigid cradle south ..."


# Fallback mnemonic for all networks - used if no network specific mnemonic is set
DEFAULT_MNEMONIC="rigid cradle south ..."

# Template provider url where "{{NETWORK}}" will be replaced by the network name
# Used in case no network specific provider url is defined
#PROVIDER_URL_TEMPLATE=https://{{NETWORK}}.rpc.mydomain.xyz



# A few scripts do subgraph queries, for those an endpoint must be configured
#ETH_GOERLI_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT=...
#
# Alternatively, you can also provide an endpoint template
#SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT_TEMPLATE=https://{{NETWORK}}.subgraph.mydomain.xyz


# Check truffle-config.js for a list of pre-configured networks and their names
