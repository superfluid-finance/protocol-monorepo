# Changelog
All notable changes to the ethereum-contracts will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [UNRELEASED]

### Breaking

- **Monorepo:** Yarn 4 (`nodeLinker: node-modules`). Use `corepack enable` and `yarn install --immutable`.
- `SuperTokenFactory`: removed canonical wrapper APIs (`createCanonicalERC20Wrapper`, `computeCanonicalERC20WrapperAddress`, `getCanonicalERC20Wrapper`, `initializeCanonicalWrapperSuperTokens`).
  These were added in v1.4.3, but the necessary steps to make this feature available and useful were never taken.
  In order to not confuse devs (human or non), this part of the API is therefore removed.
  The reserved storage mapping is renamed to `_canonicalWrapperSuperTokensDeprecated` (slot preserved for UUPS upgrade safety).

## [v1.15.2]

### Changed

- Updated foundry to 1.7.1 and forge-std to v1.16.1
- bumped solc to 0.8.35
- bumped openzeppelin-contracts submodule to v5.6.1

### Breaking
- `ERC1820RegistryCompiled`: renamed the constant fields (`at` -> `ADDRESS`, `bin` -> `BYTECODE`) because `at` became a reserved keyword in solc 0.8.35. Only affects tests.

## [v1.15.1]

### Added

- `ClearMacroForwarderV1`: a new macro forwarder that executes EIP-712-signed meta-transactions with properties giving it additional security guarantees.
- `ClearMacroForwarderV1WithPermit2`: variant of `ClearMacroForwarderV1` which supports Permit2 for upgrading underlying tokens and executing a macro with just one wallet action.
- `ClearMacroBase`: a new base contract for clear macro implementations that support multiple actions.

### Changed

- Tracking foundry/forge updates in flake.nix: now with version 1.7.1

### Breaking

- `IUserDefinedMacro` renamed to `IMacro`.
- `MacroForwarder` renamed to `BlindMacroForwarder`.

## [v1.15.0]

### Added

- `SuperToken`: the contract admin can enable/disable a _Yield Backend_ in order to generate a yield on the underlying asset.
- `SuperToken`: added `VERSION()` which returns the version string of the logic contract set for the SuperToken, and inline CHANGELOG.

### Changed

- EVM target changed from _shanghai_ to _cancun_.
- Update solhint to v6.
- Updated to "hardhat@2.27.2".

## [v1.14.1]

### Added
- GDA _autoconnect_ feature: now any account can connect pool members using `tryConnectPoolFor()` as long as they have less than 4 connection slots occupied for that Super Token. This allows for smoother onboarding of new users, allowing Apps to make sure tokens distributed via GDA immediately show up in user's wallets. Accounts can opt out of this by using `setConnectPermission()`, this is mainly supposed to be used by contracts.

### Changed
- Refactored `GeneralDistributionAgreementV1`: extracted functionality which reads/writes agreement data from/to the token contract into dedicated libraries:
  - `GDAv1StorageLib` contains data structures and related encoders/decoders.
  - `GDAv1StorageReader` contains getters reading agreement data from the token contract, allowing contracts to get this data without making a call to the GDA contract.
  - `GDAv1StorageWriter` contains functions for writing agreement data to the token contract. This can only be used by the GDA contract itself.
- bump solc to "0.8.30".
- Changed EVM target from `paris` to `shanghai` because now all networks with supported Superfluid deployment support it.
- Don't emit ERC20 `Approval` events on `transferFrom` operations. This is consistent with the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation from v5 onwards. Change effective only for SuperTokens using the latest logic.

### Fixed
- `ISuperfluidPool`: `getClaimable` and `getClaimableNow` could previously return non-zero values for connected pools, which was inconsistent with what `claimAll` would actually do in this situation (claim nothing).

### Breaking
- Updated OpenZeppelin library from v.4.9.6 to v5.4.0.
The import path now includes the major version, making it easier for contracts integrating with this protocol to use a different major version of OpenZeppelin.
Projects using Superfluid contracts as a dependency need to configure a mapping:
  - Foundry: add this to remappings: `'@openzeppelin-v5/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/',`
  - Hardhat (>=v2.17.2): add `@openzeppelin/contracts` as a project dependency and a subtask in your hardhat config:
```
import { TASK_COMPILE_GET_REMAPPINGS } from "hardhat/builtin-tasks/task-names";

subtask(TASK_COMPILE_GET_REMAPPINGS).setAction(
    async (_, __, runSuper) => {
        const remappings = await runSuper();
        return {
            ...remappings,
            "@openzeppelin-v5/contracts/": "@openzeppelin/contracts/",
        };
    }
);
```
- `CFASuperAppBase`: `onFlowDeleted` is replaced by `onInFlowDeleted` and `onOutFlowDeleted`.
  This is safer because the latter hook handles a case (outgoing flow being deleted by its receiver) which is often not expected.
  In the past, apps creating outflows had to explicitly distinguish between the 2 possible triggers in order to avoid potentially invalid state changes or even jailing.
  Most apps will want to implement just `onInFlowDeleted`.
- `CFASuperAppBase`: added `flowRate` argument to `onFlowCreated` and `onFlowUpdated`.
- PoolMemberNFT pruning: `IPoolMemberNFT` and `PoolMemberNFT` removed, `POOL_MEMBER_NFT()` removed from `ISuperToken`.

## [v1.14.0]

Defect release, don't use!

## [v1.13.0]

### Added
- `SuperToken` now implements [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) (permit extension for EIP-20 signed approvals).
- `SuperfluidPool` now has additional methods `increaseMemberUnits` and `decreaseMemberUnits` which allow the pool admin to change member units parameterized with delta amounts.

### Changed
- Curation of the SuperApp registration allowlist can now be delegated by governance to a newly added `ACL` contract.

### Breaking
- `SuperfluidPool` does no longer mint and burn EIP-721 tokens (NFTs) on member unit updates. The gas overhead of this operation caused friction for integrations with other protocols (e.g. Uniswap V4).

## [v1.12.1]

### Added
- Superfluid Pools now implement `IERC20Metadata`, thus going forward have a name, symbol and decimals
- `IGeneralDistributionAgreementV1.createPoolWithCustomERC20Metadata` and `SuperTokenV1Library.createPoolWithCustomERC20Metadata` for creating pools with custom ERC20 metadata
- `SuperTokenV1Library`
  - overloaded `claimAll` for the msg.sender to claim for themselves
  - added `flowWithCtx` and `flowFromWithCtx`

### Changed
- Fixed deployment of SimpleForwarder (solved an issue which caused batch operation `OPERATION_TYPE_SIMPLE_FORWARD_CALL` to always revert)
- `SuperTokenV1Library.getFlowRate` and `SuperTokenV1Library.getFlowInfo` now also allow querying the flowrate between pools and pool members
- Superfluid Pools now emit a Transfer event when changing units with `updateMemberUnits`.
- Dependency foundry updated to 1.0

### Breaking
- `SuperTokenV1Library.distributeFlow`: return `actualFlowRate` instead of a bool
- `SuperTokenV1Library.distribute`: return `actualAmount` instead of a bool

## [v1.12.0]

### Added
- `SuperTokenV1Library`
  - added agreement specific variants for `getFlowRate`, `getFlowInfo`, `getNetFlowRate` and `getNetFlowInfo`, e.g. `getCFAFlowRate`, `getGDAFlowRate`, ...
  - added `flow` for changing CFA flows, can be used instead of the CRUD methods
  - added `flowFrom` for changing CFA flows using ACL permissions, can be used instead of the CRUD methods
  - added `distribute` and `distributeFlow` variants (overloaded) without `from` argument
  - added `transferX` and `flowX` for agreement abstracted instant or flow transfers/distributions
  - added `getTotalAmountReceivedFromPool` (alias for `getTotalAmountReceivedByMember`)
- Host: added `ISuperfluid.getERC2771Forwarder`: to be used by batch call targets who want to use ERC-2771 for msg sender preservation
- Utility contracts for forwarding of calls in the context of batch operations:
  - `SimpleForwarder`: for forwarding arbitrary calls to arbitrary targets
  - `ERC2771Forwarder`: for forwarding arbitrary calls to arbitrary targets with msg sender authenticated according to ERC-2771. Requires the target contract to recognize it as trusted forwarder.

### Breaking
- Removed `CFAv1Library`, superseded by `SuperTokenV1Library`.
- The IDA is now declared as deprecated, shouldn't be used anymore. The GDA covers all its functionality.
- Removed `IDAv1Library`.
- `SuperTokenV1Library`
  - removed IDA specific functionality. `distribute` now maps to the GDA.
  - `getFlowRate` and `getFlowInfo` now work return the GDA flowrate/info if the receiver is a pool (previously it would return 0). In order to specifically query the CFA flowrate, use the newly added `getCFAFlowRate` and `getCFAFlowInfo`.
  - removed `updateMemberUnits` (use ISuperfluidPool.updateMemberUnits instead)
- Source file `SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol` renamed to `SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.t.sol`
- Source file `FoundrySuperfluidTester.sol` renamed to `FoundrySuperfluidTester.t.sol`

## [v1.11.1]

### Changed

- `MacroForwarder` made payable.
- `IUserDefinedMacro`: added a method `postCheck()` which allows to verify state changes after running the macro.
- `SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer` now also deploys and `MacroForwarder` and enables it as trusted forwarder.
- `deploy-test-environment.js` now deploys fUSDC (the underlying) with 6 decimals (instead of 18) to better resemble the actual USDC.

### Fixed

- GDA Pools are not multi-tokens ready, added a permission check (#2010).

## [v1.11.0]

### Breaking

- FlowNFTs are being deprecated. The hooks aren't invoked anymore by CFA and GDA.

## [v1.10.0]

### Breaking

- ISuperfuidPool self-transfer is not allowed.
- FoundrySuperfluidTester is test with forge-std@v1.9.1, which may break with 1.7.x and prio forge-std lib.
- Removing SafeGasLibrary, in favor of CallbackUtils.

### Added

- `batchCall` now supports 4 additional operation types:
  - `OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERTOKEN_UPGRADE_TO`
  - `OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERTOKEN_DOWNGRADE_TO`
  - `OPERATION_TYPE_SIMPLE_FORWARD_CALL`
  - `OPERATION_TYPE_ERC2771_FORWARD_CALL`
  The latter 2 allow to add arbitrary contract calls to batch call.
- Solidity library CallbackUtils for dealing with EIP-150 1/64-rule for callbacks.

### Changed

- increase SuperApp callback gas limit on some chains, to be queried with `host.CALLBACK_GAS_LIMIT()`
- Remove try/catch in PoolNFT callbacks.
- upgrade flake locked foundry: 0.2.0 (20b3da1 2024-07-02T00:18:52.435480726Z).
- relax pragram solidity with "^0.8.23".
- bump solc to 0.8.26.
- Faster SuperAppMockAux._burnGas implementation.
- foundry test reorg:
  - rename '.prop.sol' to '.prop.t.sol';
  - mark mock-contract files with 't.sol' to be skipped by foundry build automatically;
  - move some mock contracts to test/foundry if they are only used for foundry tests.

## Fixes

- Fix a few types and build warnings.
- Make testTokenURIIsExpected work with non via-ir pipeline.

## [v1.9.1] - 2024-03-19

### Breaking

- The abstract base contract`SuperAppBaseFlow` was renamed to `CFASuperAppBase` and doesn't self-register in the constructor anymore.
This allows the contract to be used with a SuperApp factory pattern and by logic contracts in the context of the proxy pattern.
Note: this will NOT break any deployed contracts, only affects undeployed Super Apps in case the ethereum-contracts dependency is updated.
- `UniversalIndexData`, `PoolMemberData` and `FlowDistributionData` structs moved from `IGeneralDistributionAgreementV1.sol` to `GeneralDistributionAgreementV1.sol`
- `PoolIndexData`, `MemberData` structs moved from `ISuperfluidPool.sol` to `SuperfluidPool.sol`

### Added

- New utility: MacroForwarder - a trusted forwarder extensible with permission-less macro contracts.
- New protocol contract view functions:
  - `gdaV1.getFlow`
  - `gdaV1.getAccountFlowInfo`
  - `pool.poolOperatorGetIndex`
  - `pool.getTotalAmountReceivedByMember`

  - `getGDANetFlowInfo`
  - `getPoolAdjustmentFlowRate`
  - `getTotalAmountReceivedByMember`

### Changed

- bump solc to 0.8.23
- `superTokenV1Library.getNetFlowInfo` sums CFA and GDA net flow info

### Fixes

  - Migration: Use `IERC20Metadata` instead, as this replaces the previous contracts
- `build/typechain-ethers-v5` is removed from the npm package
  - Migration: Consume the ABIs and utilize whatever tool you'd like to generate types from them

### Added

- New agreement: `GeneralDistributionAgreement` added which enables 1-to-N flowing distributions in addition to 1-to-N instant distributions via the `SuperfluidPool` contract
- Added 'test-slither' yarn sub-task.
- Expose `SuperToken._underlyingDecimals` with `SuperToken.getUnderlyingDecimals()`
- Expose `_toUnderlyingAmount(uint256 amount)` with `toUnderlyingAmount(uint256 amount)`
- `batchCall` supports payable `OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERFLUID_CALL_APP_ACTION`: only the first `OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERFLUID_CALL_APP_ACTION` will be payable
- Added two new functions to `SuperfluidGovernanceBase.sol`: `changeSuperTokenAdmin` and `batchChangeSuperTokenAdmin`
- `Superfluid.changeSuperTokenAdmin()` function added to be called via governance for tokens with no admin address
- Added an overloaded `initialize` to `SuperToken.sol`, which additionally takes `address admin` if you want to initialize the token with an admin address
- `SuperToken.changeAdmin(address newAdmin)` added which is only callable by the current admin, the "admin" of a SuperToken can change the admin and update the proxy contract's pointer to a logic contract
  > Note that the default admin (when address(0)) is the host contract as is currently the case
- Note that the admin is stored in the EIP-1967 admin storage slot (`0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103`)
- `SuperToken.getAdmin()` added to retrieve the admin address
- `SuperTokenFactory.createERC20Wrapper()` overloads added to create a SuperToken AND explicitly initialize a SuperToken with an admin
- New explicit functions: `deployTestFrameworkWithEthersV5` and `deployTestFrameworkWithEthersV6` in `deploy-test-framework.js`
  - `deployTestFramework` is still there, but it is considered deprecated now

### Changed

- Reuse config keys from `SuperfluidGovernanceConfigs` instead of duplicating them in `ConstantFlowAgreementV1`.
- Deprecating `registerAppWithKey` and `registerAppByFactory`: DO NOT USE for new deployments
  - Simplification of Super App registration: use `registerApp` in all cases going forward.
  - Use `registerApp(uint256 configWord)` to be called by the super app in the constructor or `registerApp(ISuperApp app, uint256 configWord)` to be called by any address with a valid app registration config key

### Fixes
- [`dev-scripts/deploy-test-framework.js`](dev-scripts/deploy-test-framework.js) compatible with both ethers-v5 and ethers-v6 now
- `distribute` and `distributeWithCtx` API made consistent

- `SuperAppBaseCFA` base contract to simplify CFA SuperApp development
- `SuperTokenDeployer.sol` for deploying SuperTokens in local testing (split from `SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol`)

### Changed
- `SuperToken` logic contract takes `ConstantOutflowNFT` and `ConstantInflowNFT` proxy contract addresses
- `SuperTokenFactory` logic contract takes `ConstantOutflowNFT` and `ConstantInflowNFT` and handles the upgrade logic for the NFTs
- Utilize internal `_host` in CFA instead of external call to host on the token

## [v1.4.3] - 2022-10-27
### Added

- `createCanonicalERC20Wrapper` added for creating ERC20 Wrapper Super tokens which will be added to a canonical wrapper super token list based on naming convention and semi-upgradeability. This will be the recommended way of creating ERC20 Wrapper moving forward.
