> EVM contracts implementation for the Superfluid Protocol

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://superfluid.finance)

### ✨ [Superfluid App](https://app.superfluid.finance/)

### 📖 [Docs](https://docs.superfluid.finance)

## Usage

If you're building a dapp using existing protocol or Super Token contracts, then you should use [`@superfluid-finance/sdk-core`](/packages/sdk-core). [Here](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/networks/networks) you can find a list of networks where the Superfluid protocol is already deployed.

If you're building a smart contract that uses Superfluid protocol, or even your own [SuperApp](https://docs.superfluid.finance/), then great! This is definitely the place to be.

### Installation

Prerequisites:
- [node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download). The project recommends 24, and is tested with node 20,22,24.
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

Once you have set up your project, cd into its base directory and add the package:

#### hardhat
```sh
$ yarn add @superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts
```

#### foundry

```sh
$ forge install superfluid-protocol-monorepo=superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo@dev
$ # or using ethereum-contracts@v1.6.0
$ forge install superfluid-protocol-monorepo=superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo@$(git ls-remote https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo.git ethereum-contracts@v1.6.0 | awk '{print $1}')
```

### Dependencies

Next you need to satisfy the OpenZeppelin contracts dependency v5 of the Superfluid contracts.
How to do that depends on your project's setup.

#### foundry

**Your project uses OZ v5**

If your project already uses OZ v5, just add a remapping in your `foundry.toml` or `remappings.txt` file:
```
@openzeppelin-v5/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```
(adjust the path to the openzeppelin-contracts directory in your project)

**Your project doesn't use OZ v5**

Install the v5 package:
```
forge install openzeppelin-contracts-v5=https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@release-v5.5
```
and add a remapping in your `foundry.toml` or `remappings.txt` file:
```
@openzeppelin-v5/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-v5/
```

#### hardhat

**Your project uses OZ v5**

If you have the npm package `@openzeppelin/contracts` v5 installed, instruct hardhat to use it via a remapping, by adding this to your `hardhat.config.[js|ts]` file:
```
const {TASK_COMPILE_GET_REMAPPINGS} = require("hardhat/builtin-tasks/task-names");

subtask(TASK_COMPILE_GET_REMAPPINGS).setAction(
    async (_, __, runSuper) => {
        const remappings = await runSuper();
        return {
            ...remappings,
            "@openzeppelin-v5/contracts/": "@openzeppelin/contracts/",
        };
    }
);
```
Note: this requires hardat v2.17.2 or higher.

**Your project doesn't use OZ v5**

If your project doesn't use `@openzeppelin/contracts` v5, or uses another version you want to stick to, you can install the v5 package in a custom path, by adding this to the section `dependencies` in your `package.json` file:
```
"@openzeppelin-v5/contracts": "npm:@openzeppelin/contracts@5"
```

In this case you don't need to add a remapping to your hardhat config.

### Smart Contract

You can then import Superfluid interfaces or contracts into your contracts like this:

```js
import { IConstantFlowAgreementV1 } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/agreements/IConstantFlowAgreementV1.sol";
```
The paths in the npm package are the same as in this repository.

### Writing Tests

For all future tests, we will be using Foundry as the main framework for writing property, integration and invariant tests.
Please read this section if you would like to contribute to the test suite.

#### Testing Principles

The ultimate purpose of testing is to **ensure correctness** of expected behavior. We aim to write the tests in a way that is easy to understand, maintain and extend.

In order to achieve this we utilize a few techniques:
- **testing framework**: to help with test harnessing and to provide a nice DX when writing tests which leads to nice DX when reading as well.
- **abstractions**: to prevent code duplication and to make the test code less error prone and more readable, we use abstractions to abstract away common test code.
  - This includes helper functions which can be reused across multiple tests.
- **naming conventions & organization**: this provides structure and makes searching and filtering for test files, contracts easier and more immediately understandable.

#### Types of Test

There are four types of tests that are written to ensure correctness: are property, integration and invariant tests.

- Property tests aim to ensure correct behavior in isolation in a single function.
- Integration tests aim to ensure correct behavior in the interaction between two or more contracts.
- Invariant tests aim to ensure that certain invariants always hold true, no matter the sequence of functions being called.

#### Test Contract File Naming

Tests should be named in the following format: `ContractName.(prop|t|invariant).sol` depending on the type of test you are writing.

#### Folder structure

Tests should be placed in the `test/foundry` folder. The folder structure must follow that of the contracts folder. For example, if you are writing property tests for the `ConstantFlowAgreementV1.sol` contract, the test file will be placed in `test/foundry/agreements/ConstantFlowAgreement.prop.sol`.

#### Test Contract Naming

The naming convention for test contracts is taken from:
- The contract you are testing (e.g. `ConstantFlowAgreementV1.sol`)
- The type of test you are writing (e.g. `property, integration, invariant`)
- The name of the contract will follow the format: `ContractName.(Property|Integration|Invariant)Test`
e.g. the property testing contract in `ConstantFlowAgreementV1.prop.sol` should be titled:

```solidity
contract ConstantFlowAgreementV1PropertyTest {
    ...
}
```

The reason for this naming convention is for multiple reasons:
- allow for easy searching of test contracts using an IDE
- allow easy filtering of tests to run locally or in CI

#### Test Naming

The naming convention for test functions must use camelCase and should be descriptive enough so the reader can have a good idea of what the test is doing before even reading the actual test code.

There are two primary type of tests written for unit and integration tests:
- tests that are expected to pass
- tests that are expected to revert

For passing tests, the naming convention for the function is: `testADescriptiveName()`. For example:

```solidity
function testIncreaseFlowRateAllowance() {
    ...
}
```

For tests that are expected to revert, the naming convention for the function is: `testRevertADescriptiveName()`. For example:

```solidity
function testRevertIfDecreaseFlowRateAllowanceAndACLCreateFlow() {
    ...
}
```

#### Internal Helper Functions

See [`FoundrySuperfluidTester.t.sol`](test/foundry/FoundrySuperfluidTester.t.sol) for examples of commonly used internal helper functions.
If you are writing a test that requires a helper function, the helper function is prefixed with `_` and uses camelCase to indicate that it is an internal helper function. For example:

```solidity
function _assertFlowOperatorData(AssertFlowOperatorData memory data) internal {
    ...
}
```

It is also recommended to create and pass structs to the helper functions to make the test code more readable. For example:

```solidity
// this is easier to understand what is going on before reading the _assertFlowOperatorData function
_assertFlowOperatorData(
    AssertFlowOperatorData({
        superToken: superToken,
        flowOperatorId: oldFlowOperatorId,
        expectedPermissions: oldPermissions,
        expectedFlowRateAllowance: oldFlowRateAllowance +
            flowRateAllowanceIncreaseDelta -
            flowRateAllowanceDecreaseDelta
    })
);

// this is a bit more confusing and may require constant jumping back and forth to understand what is going on
_assertFlowOperatorData(
    superToken,
    oldFlowOperatorId,
    oldPermissions,
    oldFlowRateAllowance +
        flowRateAllowanceIncreaseDelta -
        flowRateAllowanceDecreaseDelta
);
```

Additionally, we use foundry's assert functions to make debugging easier by providing a descriptive and unique error message. For example:

```solidity
assertEq(newFlowRateAllowance, expectedFlowRateAllowance, "CFAv1 ACL: unexpected flow rate allowance");
```

### Deploying Superfluid Protocol for Testing

> NOTE: you must deploy erc1820 registry before deploying the Superfluid protocol. You can do this by running `npx hardhat run dev-scripts/deploy-erc1820.js --network localhost` in the terminal.

#### Hardhat
You can import the `deployContractsAndToken` function from the `dev-scripts/deploy-contracts-and-token.js` file and use it in your testing scripts. It will deploy the Superfluid protocol and deploy Wrapper, Native Asset and Pure SuperToken's for you.
Alternatively, you can execute `npx hardhat run dev-scripts/run-deploy-contracts-and-token.js --network localhost` to deploy the contracts and tokens to a local hardhat node, you will know this worked if you see the terminal window with your local hardhat node running spit out a bunch of things.

#### Foundry
In foundry, you can use the `SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer` to deploy the Superfluid protocol in a forge environment (no local blockchain). For example:

```solidity
import "forge-std/Test.sol";

import { ERC1820RegistryCompiled } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/libs/ERC1820RegistryCompiled.sol";
import { SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.t.sol";
import { TestToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/TestToken.sol";
import { SuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/superfluid/SuperToken.sol";

contract SomeTest is Test {

    SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.Framework internal sf;
    SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer internal deployer;

    function setUp() {
        vm.etch(ERC1820RegistryCompiled.ADDRESS, ERC1820RegistryCompiled.BYTECODE);

        deployer = new SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer();
        deployer.deployTestFramework();
        sf = deployer.getFramework();
        (TestToken underlyingToken, SuperToken superToken) = deployer.deployWrapperSuperToken("MR Token", "MRx", 18, 10000000);
    }
}
```
See [SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.t.sol](contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.t.sol) for more details.

You can also deploy to a local blockchain (`hardhat` or `anvil`) via a forge script. For example, an example `Deploy.s.sol` file:

```solidity
import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "forge-std/Test.sol";

import { ERC1820RegistryCompiled } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/libs/ERC1820RegistryCompiled.sol";
import { SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol";
import { TestToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/TestToken.sol";
import { SuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/superfluid/SuperToken.sol";

contract DeployScript is Script, Test {
    function run() external {
        vm.etch(ERC1820RegistryCompiled.ADDRESS, ERC1820RegistryCompiled.BYTECODE);
        SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer deployer = new SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer();
        deployer.deployTestFramework();
        SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.Framework memory framework = deployer.getFramework();
        (TestToken underlyingToken, SuperToken superToken) = deployer.deployWrapperSuperToken("MR Token", "MRx", 18, 10000000);
    }
}
```

The command to run the script: `forge script foundry-scripts/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url http://localhost:8545`.

## Contributing

If you want contribute to Superfluid protocol contracts instead of just interfacing with them, the setup is a bit different.

### Setup Development Environment

Prerequisites: You need node.js v20+ and yarn installed.

First, check out this repository and cd into it.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo.git
cd protocol-monorepo/
```

Then install dependencies and do an initial build:

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
```

Now cd to the contracts directory:
```sh
cd packages/ethereum-contracts/
```

Then prepare an `.env` file (see `.env.template`).
The most important config items are RPC endpoint (`<X>_PROVIDER_URL`) and a sender account (`<X>_MNEMONIC`), _<X>_ being a network specific prefix - e.g. `OPTIMISM_MAINNET_PROVIDER_URL`.
If you provide an actual mnemonic, the key derived at `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` will be used. You can instead also set private keys (hex format) for `<X>_MNEMONIC`.

In order to get an overview of available config items for ops scripts, look for instances of `process.env` in [`new-ops-scripts/`](new-ops-scripts/) and [`scripts/`](scripts). See [docs/ops-scripts-migration.md](docs/ops-scripts-migration.md) for the legacy `ops-scripts/` removal matrix.

### Tooling

- **Build:** `yarn build` compiles with Hardhat and Foundry only (no Truffle compile).
- **Ops:** use [`new-ops-scripts/`](new-ops-scripts/) and [`foundry-scripts/`](foundry-scripts/). Legacy `ops-scripts/` were removed in v1.16.0 — see [docs/ops-scripts-migration.md](docs/ops-scripts-migration.md).
- **npm artifacts:** use `build/hardhat/**` or `build/bundled-abi.json`; flat `build/truffle/*.json` is no longer published.


### Testing

We aim to have 100% test coverage. This requires test code to be modular, just like the contracts themselves.
The test file hierarchy in [test/contracts](test/contracts) thus reflects the contract file hierarchy in [contracts](contracts).
Mock contracts reside in [contracts](contracts) (not in the [test](test) directory, as is often the case), because that way `yarn build` will cache their artifacts in the `build` directory. This considerably speeds up test runs.

You can run either all tests, specific tests or test suites.

Run all tests:
```sh
yarn test
```

Run a specific test using the [exclusive tests](https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests) feature of MochaJS:
```sh
yarn run-hardhat test test/contracts/agreements/ConstantFlowAgreementV1.test.js
```

Run the test suite for core contracts:
```sh
yarn run-hardhat test testsuites/superfluid-core.js
```

The `pretest` script starts a local dev chain with deterministic accounts in the background, the `posttest` script stops it.
When running tests with `yarn test`, those get executed automatically (see [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts#pre--post-scripts)).

### TDD Session

When working on the contracts, a test driven approach is recommended.

#### Hardhat
You should choose the tests relevant for what you're working on using the [only keyword](https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests).
You can put the `only` keyword at any level between whole test suites (`only` appended to a top level `describe`, e.g. `describe.only`) and individual testcases (`it`, e.g. `it.only`).
With the testing scope defined, run:
```
yarn dev-hardhat
```
This has [testsuites/all-contracts.js](testsuites/all-contracts.js) as its entrypoint, but if there's an `only` keyword at any nesting level in any of the tests traversed, only that selected subset of tests will be executed.
The selected test(s) will run once when starting the session and re-run everytime you save changes in a relevant file.

You may also focus on a specific testsuite with yarn dev-hardhat:
```
yarn dev-hardhat test/contracts/libs/CallUtils.test.js
```

After finishing the session, you can stop the hardhat instance you started in the first step (Ctrl-C).
Also, don't forget to remove `only` keywords from test files before making git commits.

To generate jpeg image charts from the test output run first install these dependencies: numpy, pandas, plotly and kaleido by running:
```
python3 -m pip install -U libraryName
```

After that is done, just simply run the testDataToCharts script and put the folder containing the csv files as the first argument e.g
```
python3 testDataToCharts.py output
```

#### Foundry
On the other hand, you can run the development session with foundry with the command: `yarn dev-foundry`.

### Other Useful Commands

```
yarn run-hardhat # run hardhat
yarn run-foundry # run foundry forge
yarn run-nodemon forge test # use nodemon to run foundry test
```

### Troubleshooting

Superfluid requires the [ERC-1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) Registry contract to be deployed. That's because [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) - the basis for Super Tokens - depends on it.
If you use the deployment scripts as described above, that will be done automatically. For legacy ops-scripts, see [docs/ops-scripts-migration.md](docs/ops-scripts-migration.md).

In the [scripts folder](/scripts) you can find several scripts for deploying/configuring/querying protocol contracts.
