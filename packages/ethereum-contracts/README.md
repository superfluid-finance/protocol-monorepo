> Ethereum contracts implementation for the Superfluid Protocol

### üè† [Homepage](https://superfluid.finance)

### ‚ú® [Superfluid App](https://app.superfluid.finance/)

### üìñ [Docs](https://docs.superfluid.finance)

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Run tests

**NB!**: Since these tests take long time to execute, it is quite possible
that you want to use the [execlusive tests](https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests)
feature from MochaJS to speed up isolated feature development.

There are two major test suite:

-   Contracts (test/contracts.test.js) tests the contracts
    Each contracts test suite is named as `test/{Type}/{ContractName}.test.js`.
-   Deployment (test/deployment.test.js) tests the deployment script

```bash
yarn test
```

If you're looking to use the contracts here with your own, check out the apps in `/examples`.

One thing to keep in mind is that Superfluid relies on a persistent 1820 registry contract. This must be deployed before you can interact with the protocol. If you follow the examples and tutorials, you don't need to worry about it.

In case your curious, or really hacking away, here is an example for deploying the 1820 contract to a local Ganache. (read more about [EIP 1820 Pseudo-introspection Registry Contract](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820))

```bash
# Start Ganache on 127.0.0.1:8545
ganache-cli

# Build the contracts + prepare the SDK
yarn build

# Deploy the 1820 contract
cd packages/ethereum-contracts
npx truffle exec scripts/deploy-erc1820.js --network ganache

# Now you can run tests and interact with the protocol
yarn test
```
