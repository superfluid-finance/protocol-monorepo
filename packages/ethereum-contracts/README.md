> Ethereum contracts implementation for the Superfluid Protocol

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

If you're building a dapp using the deployed contracts (goerli or mainnet) then you should instead use [`@superfluid-finance/js-sdk`](/packages/js-sdk).

If you're building a Super App, then great! This is definitely the place to be. The contracts can be imported into your `.sol` file like this:

```js
import { IConstantFlowAgreementV1 } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/agreements/IConstantFlowAgreementV1.sol";
```

For writing tests, you can use the `TestEnvironment` helper to deploy all the necessary contracts. Currenty `TestEnvironment` only works with truffle, we are working on to support to other frameworks.

```js
const TestEnvironment = require("@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/test/TestEnvironment");

contract("My Test", accounts => {
    const t = new TestEnvironment(accounts.slice(0, 4), { isTruffle: true });
    const {
        admin: adminAddress,
        alice: aliceAddress,
    } = t.aliases;

    before(async () => {
        // Deploys a fresh set of Superfluid contracts
        await t.reset();
    });
```

The `TestEnvironment` also exposes the `@superfluid-finance/js-sdk`, so you can skip the initialization skip. Here is a quick-start example:

```js
let sf;
let superToken;

before(async () => {
    await t.reset();
    // @superfluid-finance/js-sdk will be available here
    sf = t.sf;
});

beforeEach(async () => {
    // Deploy a test token
    await t.createNewToken({ doUpgrade: true });
    ({ superToken } = t.contracts);

    // Create user objects
    admin = sf.user({ address: adminAddress, token: superToken.address });
    alice = sf.user({ address: aliceAddress, token: superToken.address });
});
```

Awesome, now that have the basics, check out the apps over in the [examples folder](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/dev/examples).

## Troubleshooting

One thing to keep in mind is that Superfluid relies on a persistent 1820 registry contract. This must be deployed before you can interact with the protocol. If you follow the examples using the `TestEnvironment` helper, you don't need to worry about it.

If you want to see examples for manually deploying contracts, check out the [scripts folder](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/scripts).

In case your curious, or really hacking away, you might want to deploy the registry manually. Here is an example for how to deploy the 1820 contract to a local Ganache. (read more about [EIP 1820 Pseudo-introspection Registry Contract](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820))

```bash
# Start Ganache on 127.0.0.1:8545
ganache-cli

# Build the contracts + prepare the SDK
yarn build

# Deploy the 1820 contract
cd packages/ethereum-contracts
npx truffle exec scripts/deploy-erc1820.js --network ganache

# Now you can run tests and interact with the protocol
yarn test
```

## Contributing

### Testing

There are two major test suite:

-   Contracts (test/contracts.test.js) tests the contracts
    Each contracts test suite is named as `test/{Type}/{ContractName}.test.js`.
-   Deployment (test/deployment.test.js) tests the deployment script

```bash
yarn test
```

Since testing can take a long time to execute, you may want to use the [execlusive tests](https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests) feature from MochaJS to isolate only the test you want. For example:

```bash
# Only run deployment.test.js
nodemon -x npx truffle test ./test/deployment.test.js
```
