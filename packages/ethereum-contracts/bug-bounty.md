# Bug Bounty

This Bug Bounty program is focused on a subset of the smart contracts in this repo with a primary interest in prevention of loss of user funds, either by direct draining of locked funds or any exploit which results in funds being stuck.

**Smart Contracts and Blockchain**

| Level |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Critical | USD $30,000 - $200,000 |
| High | USD $10,000 - $30,000 |
| Medium | USD $5,000 |
| Low | USD $2,000 |

Critical/High smart contract reports must come with a PoC in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.

**Further terms apply** - for more details on the rewards classification, bug disclosure eligibility and process, the assets in scope, the impacts that are accepted within this bug bounty program and any exclusions please refer to the [Superfluid Immunefi bug bounty page](https://immunefi.com/bounty/superfluid/). 

If you have any suggestion on any best practices or additional logic to improve our smart contracts security we invite you to reach out to our team via our [Discord](http://discord.superfluid.finance/) server, we would be happy to work with you in order to enhance Superfluid Protocolâ€™s security.
