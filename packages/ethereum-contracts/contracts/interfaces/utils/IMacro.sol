     * which take operation specific typed arguments and return the abi encoded bytes.
     * As a convention, the name of those functions shall start with `encode` and have the action name(s) appended.
     *
     * Implementing this view function(s) has several advantages:
     * - Allows to build more complex macros with internally encapsulated dispatching logic
     * - Allows to use generic tooling like Explorers to interact with the macro
     * - Allows to build auto-generated UIs based on the contract ABI
     * - Makes it easier to interface with the macro from Dapps
     *
     * See example implementations in the test macro contracts.
