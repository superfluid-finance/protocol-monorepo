     * Additional to the required interface, we recommend to implement the following function:

     *
     * It shall return abi encoded params as required as second argument of `MacroForwarder.runMacro()`.
     *
     * The function name shall be `getParams` and the return type shall be `bytes memory`.
     * The number, type and name of arguments are free to choose such that they best fit the macro use case.
     *
     * In conjunction with the name of the Macro contract, the signature should be as self-explanatory as possible.
     *
     * Example for a contract `MultiFlowDeleteMacro` which lets a user delete multiple flows in one transaction:
     * `function getParams(ISuperToken superToken, address[] memory receivers) external view returns (bytes memory)`
     *
     *
     * Implementing this view function has several advantages:
     * - Allows to use generic tooling like Explorers to interact with the macro
     * - Allows to build auto-generated UIs based on the contract ABI
     * - Makes it easier to interface with the macro from Dapps
