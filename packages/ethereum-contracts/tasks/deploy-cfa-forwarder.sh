# Usage:
# tasks/deploy-cfa-forwarder.sh <network>
#
# Example:
# tasks/deploy-cfa-forwarder.sh optimism-goerli
#
# The invoking account needs to be (co-)owner of the resolver and governance
#
# important ENV vars:
# RELEASE_VERSION, CFAFWD_DEPLOYER_PK
#
# You can use the npm package vanity-eth to get a deployer account for a given contract address:
# Example use: npx vanityeth -i cfa1 --contract
#
# For optimism the gas estimation doesn't work, requires setting EST_TX_COST
# (the value auto-detected for arbitrum should work).
#
# On some networks you may need to use override ENV vars for the deployment to succeed

# shellcheck source=/dev/null
