## SuperToken Deployer

This is a single-file Dapp for deploying SuperToken wrappers of existing ERC20 tokens.
Requires a browser with injected web3 provider (e.g. Metamask) and a local webserver.
If you have python installed, you can start a webserver with the document root set to the current directory with
```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:1337/supertoken-deployer.html.
