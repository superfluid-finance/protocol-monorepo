# Changelog

All notable changes to the SDK-core will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Map the name from subgraph to an unknown event, instead of "\_Unknown".

## [0.6.12] - 2023-10-23

### Fixed

-   Support for `CustomSuperToken` contracts without `CONSTANT_OUTFLOW_NFT()` and `CONSTANT_INFLOW_NFT()` function implemented

## [0.6.11] - 2023-10-20

### Fixed

-   Handle the case when `networkData.addresses.governance` is null. This was due to a removal of the `governance` address from the metadata for test networks in `metadata@v1.1.17`.

## [0.6.10] - 2023-10-16

### Added

-   Support for `ConstantOutflowNFT` and `ConstantInflowNFT` functions

### Fixed

-   Support for `CustomSuperToken` contracts without `getUnderlyingToken()` function implemented

## [0.6.9] - 2023-09-11

### Added

-   Support for new `increaseFlowRateAllowanceWithPermissions` and `decreaseFlowRateAllowanceWithPermissions` functions on `CFAv1` class

### Changed

-   Node dependency updates.

## [0.6.8] - 2023-07-25

### Updated

-   Metadata changes for recently added networks

## [0.6.7] - 2023-07-13

### Added

-   `BatchCall.toOperation` function which unifies `BatchCall` to `Operation` type
-   `Operation.toOperationStruct` moved from `BatchCall` to `Operation` class

### Updated

## [0.6.5] - 2023-05-12

### Fixed

-   `hostedEndpoint` might be nullable so we handle this case.

### Added

-   Support for `sepolia` network

## [0.6.4] - 2023-05-07

### Changed

-   `getPopulatedTransactionRequest` doesn't use the signer to populate the transaction anymore as `signer.sendTransaction` does it already. The double `signer.populateTransaction` was causing issues with some wallets (e.g. Rainbow Wallet)
-   Map `isNativeAssetSuperToken` to `Token` from Subgraph

## [0.6.3] - 2023-03-14

### Added

-   `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions to SuperToken class
-   Batch call support for `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`
-   `increaseFlowRateAllowance` and `decreaseFlowRateAllowance` functions to CFAv1 class
-   Add support for `activeOutgoingStreamCount`, `activeIncomingStreamCount`, `inactiveOutgoingStreamCount`, `inactiveIncomingStreamCount` properties in query for `AccountTokenSnapshot` entity
-   Add support for `rewardAddress`, `liquidationPeriod`, `patricianPeriod`, and `minimumDeposit` properties in query for `Token` entity
-   Add support for `userData` property in query for `Stream` entity
-   Add `index` (the Subgraph entity ID) field to Index events when querying from Subgraph

### Changed

-   `.exec` or `.execForward` will throw an error if the operations array is empty

## [0.6.2] - 2023-02-07

### Added

-   `streamId` to `FlowUpdatedEvent` when querying from Subgraph
-   Support for Celo

## [0.6.1] - 2022-12-20

### Changed

-   Subgraph endpoints all use hosted service endpoints by default

## [0.6.0] - 2022-12-19

### Added

-   `SuperToken` class has `send` function
-   `batchCall` supports new `send` batch operation
-   Added `downgradeTo` function on `SuperToken` class
-   Added toga events to be part of query

### Changed

-   Make `sender` field optional in CFAv1 write functions

## [0.5.9] - 2022-12-05

### Added

-   Map `deposit` to Stream when querying from Subgraph

### Fixes

-   Fix `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers/types` dependency error

## [0.5.8] - 2022-11-02

### Added

-   Support for mainnet

### Changed

-   Framework initialization for supported networks utilizes `@superfluid-finance/metadata`, but still uses the resolver for unsupported/local testing environments
    -   > NOTE: This will not create any changes when doing `Framework.create` and is just a minor optimization.
-   All transactions executed via SDK-Core have a default multiplier (1.2x) applied to the provider estimated gas limit **unless** an ethers `Overrides` object is passed during creation of the `Operation`.
-   There is also the option to pass in an explicit multiplier when executing transactions: `Operation.exec(signer, 1.32)`.

## [0.5.7] - 2022-10-13

### Breaking

-   `CFAv1Forwarder` integrated into SDK-Core and will be the default way of calling CFA agreements and `sender` is now a required property.
-   Migration: pass sender into the affected CFAv1 callAgreement functions - `create/update/deleteFlow`.
    > NOTE: You must pass `shouldUseCallAgreement` explicitly as a property if you want to execute these calls via the Host.

### Added

-   typechain files consumed from `@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts` and exported from SDK-Core

## [0.5.6] - 2022-09-07

### Fixes

-   Correct `subgraphAPIEndpoint` in `getResolverData`

### Breaking

-   Don't wrap `SubgraphClient` with `SFError`

## [0.5.5] - 2022-08-31

### Added

-   Support for: `optimism-goerli` and `arbitrum-goerli` added

### Breaking

-   Support for: `rinkeby`, `ropsten`, `kovan`, `optimism-kovan` and `arbitrum-rinkeby` removed
-   Don't throw `SFError` when executing `Operation` or `BatchCall`; let the original error bubble up

### Fixes

-   Serialize a much smaller version of the cause in `SFError` (only `name`, `message`, `code`)
-   Change `SFError.name` from "Error" to "SFError"

# [0.5.4] - 2022-08-19

### Fixes

-   Properly console the cause, not the caught serialization error

## [0.5.3] - 2022-08-15

### Added

-   Map `indexId` to `IndexSubscription` when querying from Subgraph

### Fixes

-   Catch and handle serialization error

## [0.5.2] - 2022-07-26

### Added

-   Support for `isNativeAssetSuperToken` property on SuperToken entity queries
-   `callAppAction` Operation creator added to `Host` class

### Breaking

-   `BatchCall.getCallDataFunctionArgs` deprecates the old `BatchCall.getCallAgreementFunctionArgs`
    -   Migration:
        -   Replace `getCallAgreementFunctionArgs` with `getCallDataFunctionArgs` and pass in the fragment/ABI as the first argument, whilst keeping the same `callData` argument.
-   `Host.populateCallAgreementTxnAndReturnOperation` is replaced by `Host.callAgreement`
    -   Migration:
        -   Replace instances of `populateCallAgreementTxnAndReturnOperation` with `callAgreement`

### Fixes

-   Handle `CALL_APP_ACTION` operation type correctly in SDK-Core when doing a batch call
-   Undefined `process` in `constants.ts` in React and client-side apps using SDK-Core directly

## [0.5.1] - 2022-07-26

### Fixes

-   Patch fix serializeError strange serialization

## [0.5.0] - 2022-07-14

### Added

-   Support for SetEvent and Subgraph v1.4.4
-   `Framework.operation` method for easily creating `Operation` instances

### Fixes

-   Compile AJV validations to prevent unsafe-eval and did not allow SDK-Core usage inside Google Chrome extension due to unsafe-eval CSP

### Changed

-   `SFError` refactor to be more conventional. It inherits `Error` and uses `cause` to wrap internal errors.
-   Use `serialize-error` for serializing error object inside the message.
-   Export Operation & OperationType

### Breaking

-   `SFError.errorObject` renamed to `SFError.cause`

## [0.4.4] - 2022-06-30

### Added

-   Support for new event properties for Subgraph v1.4.1

### Breaking

-   Subgraph Query: `rewardAccount` renamed to `rewardAmountReceiver` on `AgreementLiquidatedV2Event` entity
-   `chainId` is a required property for framework initialization
-   `networkId` and `dataMode` no longer exist as properties for framework initialization

## [0.4.3] - 2022-06-29

### Added

-   BNB Chain support added

### Changed

-   `maybeCriticalAtTimestamp` is a nullable property now

## [0.4.2] - 2022-05-17

### Added

-   `QueryHandler` for transfer events

## [0.4.2] - 2022-05-17

### Fixed

-   Patched SDK-Core Subgraph files to be in sync with V1 Subgraph endpoint

## [0.4.1] - 2022-05-14

### Added

-   Avalanche Network Support

### Changed

-   Network constants consistent with canonical Superfluid name

## [0.4.0] - 2022-05-06

### Added

-   Added option to specify block details when querying through a `SubgraphQueryHandler`
-   Added Subgraph's `_meta` table query
-   Added `tokenSymbol` for `SubgraphQueryHandler` entity queries where `token` (token ID) was previously included
-   Added `PageNumberPaging` for UI development friendly pagination API
-   Added `AllPaging` to recursively query all results from Subgraph
-   Added support for `TypedDocumentNode` for `SubgraphClient`
-   Expose underlying ethers.js contracts for each class: CFAv1, Host, IDAv1 and `contracts` property in `Framework` class
-   Added new ACL function support: authorizing flow operator permissions and create/update/delete flow by operator
-   Added `nativeTokenSymbol` property to `constants.ts`
-   Split `SuperToken` class into: `WrapperSuperToken`, `PureSuperToken` and `NativeAssetSuperToken` classes
-   Added `loadWrapperSuperToken`, `loadNativeAssetSuperToken`, and `loadPureSuperToken` super token initialization functions
-   Support `upgrade`, `upgradeTo` and `downgrade` functions via `NativeAssetSuperToken`
-   Added `upgradeTo` to `WrapperSuperToken` class as this was missing as well

### Changed

-   Renamed `Token` to `ERC20Token`
-   Exported `ERC20Token`
-   Renamed `PagedResult.data` to `PagedResult.items`
-   Moved `listAllResults` into separate function from `Query` object
-   Removed `SubgraphClient.batchRequests` because Subgraph Node didn't support it

### Internal

-   Use `eslint-plugin-prettier` over separate `prettier` instance

### Breaking

-   The `SuperToken` class is now an abstract base class and no longer contains the functions `upgrade` and `downgrade`.
-   `underlyingToken` is possibly undefined on `SuperToken`: `WrapperSuperToken` has `underlyingToken`, but `PureSuperToken` and `NativeAssetSuperToken` do not.
    > NOTE: These changes are due to the split of `SuperToken` into `WrapperSuperToken`, `PureSuperToken` and `NativeAssetSuperToken` classes.
    -   Migration:
        -   if you are unsure of the type of the super token, you can use: `await framework.loadSuperToken("0x...");`
        -   if you want to load a wrapper super token, use: `await framework.loadWrapperSuperToken("DAIx");`
        -   if you want to load a native asset super token, use: `await framework.loadNativeAssetSuperToken("ETHx");`
        -   if you want to load a pure super token, use: `await framework.loadPureSuperToken("0x...");`

## [0.3.2] - 2022-03-16

### Added

-   Added "optimism-mainnet" and "arbitrum-one" support

## [0.3.1] - 2022-02-16

### Added

-   Added `indexValueCurrent` to `IndexSubscription` query to optimize calculating "total amount distributed" in consuming applications ([#629])
-   Added `indexTotalUnits` to `IndexSubscription` query to optimize calculating "pool percentage" in consuming applications ([#630])

### Fixed

-   Typo for `networkName: "arbitrum-rinkeby"` fixed (was expecting `"arbitrium-rinkeby"`) in `Framework.create` ([#637])

### Breaking

-   Using `"xdai"` as the `networkName` will no longer work. Updated to `"gnosis"`
    -   Migration: change `networkName` from `"xdai"` to `"gnosis"`

## [0.3.0] - 2022-02-02

### Added

-   New query handlers to cover full spectrum of Subgraph querying capabilities
    -   Used by the new release of SDK-redux
    -   Lacks an easy-to-use API for average SDK-core user

### Changed

-   `_ethers` is not exported for UMD build anymore. Use `window._ethers` instead.
-   `SFError` and `ErrorType` are now exported
-   Generated Subgraph types are now exported (`*_Filter` and `*_OrderBy` types)
    -   There are a lot of Subgraph types, so it does make the namespace crowded. We'll alleviate it in a later release.

## [0.2.1] - 2022-01-31

### Added

-   Load `SuperToken` by token symbol as long as the token is listed on the resolver ([#588])

-   Simpler provider logic for Framework creation ([#537])
-   Use V1 instead of devSubgraph endpoints ([#550])
-   `superTokenFactoryAddress` removed from `IConfig` interface ([#556])

### Fixed

-   Outdated README.md cleanup and updates ([#520], [#524], [#526], [#530], [#537], [#549], [#556])
-   `BatchCall` for callAgreement functions fixed, flow rate calculation utils logic fixed ([#526])
-   Improper base 18 number for flow rate calculation utils ([#545])
-   single network deploy implemented ([#506])
-   eslint errors and .json imports fixed ([#535])

### Breaking

-   Breaking change: Framework.create interface breaking change:`web3Ethers` and `hardhatEthers` properties removed ([#537])
    -   Migration: if you were using one of these two properties, change the property `web3Ethers` and `hardhatEthers` to `provider`
-   Breaking change: non Framework initialized `batchCall` constructor arguments interface change: `config` property removed ([#556])
    -   Migration: if you instantiated a `BatchCall` without using Framework, you need to remove the config property and replace it with the property: `hostAddress`
