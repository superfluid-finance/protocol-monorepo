This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

More specifically, this example shows off how to use `@superfluid-finance/sdk-redux` using Next.js with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). Inspired by this repository: https://github.com/phryneas/ssr-experiments/tree/main/nextjs-blog

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
