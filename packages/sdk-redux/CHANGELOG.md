- Update `@reduxjs/toolkit` & `@superfluid-finance/sdk-core` dependencies

- Add `accountTokenSnapshotLog` & `tokenStatisticLog` endpoints
- Add `isSubgraphInSync` & `blockTransactionSucceededIn` to a tracked transaction
- Export `getSerializeQueryArgs` & `CacheTagTypes`

## [0.3.0] - 2022-04-13

### Many changes and additions

- Rename mutations and queries for better ordering in source/file explorers:
  - For example, "CreateFlow" renamed to "FlowCreateMutation" to go along with "FlowUpdateMutation" and "FlowDeleteMutation" etc
- "MonitorForEventsToInvalidateCache" moved to Subgraph API slice because it uses Subgraph, not an RPC
- Removed `sfApi` completely which combined Subgraph & RPC endpoints. Replaced by leaving just `subgraphApi` (only Subgraph as data source) & `rpcApi` (only RPC as data source)
- Redux slices are required to be set up using `*slice*.reducerPath` syntax
- Tracked transactions can now contain user defined extra data (see `*tracked transactin*.extraData`) which can be specified through the invoked mutation
- `userData` can now be specified through flow mutations
- Tracked transactions now have titles to identify the intent by
- Make it possible to initiate transaction tracking for old pending transactions (see `initiateOldPendingTransactionsTrackingThunk`)
- Transaction tracking invalidates RPC slice and Subgraph slice separately
  - RPC is invalidated in its entirety for now
  - Subgraph is polled for the block events of the successful transaction to invalidate the slice normally (based on the event type and its data)
- Save timestamp on the tracked transaction of when tracking started
- Simplify caching logic to just "GENERAL" & "SPECIFIC" tags (NOTE: cache tagging mechanism and the invalidation mechanism need more work)
  - The idea behind the simplified chaching logic is that sometimes we need to _force_ invalidate the whole chain or the whole token cache. That's then we use the _general_ tag for invalidation. As a rule of thumb, all queries _should_ provide general cache tags. Other times, when we're listening to the blockchain and only want to invalidate specific parts and not _over_ invalidate the cache, then we use the _specific_ cache tags.
