Communism comes in various forms, and all have its own money distribution "system".

\ignore{
\begin{code}
module Money.Distribution.Communism where

import Money.Distribution.Concepts ( MoneyDistribution )
\end{code}
}

\lhsparagraph{Utopian Communism}

In its utopian form, there is no more scarcity, but the number of its members are finite. Hence the any meaningful money
unit would also come with unlimited liquidity.

\begin{code}
data Infinite a = Infinite | Only a

data UtopianCommunism

instance MoneyDistribution UtopianCommunism
\end{code}

\lhsparagraph{Dystopian Communism}

In its more likely form, there is simply nothing, and everyone owns nothing.

\begin{code}
data DystopianCommunism

instance MoneyDistribution DystopianCommunism
\end{code}

\lhsparagraph{Autocratic Communism}

In a more realistic form, the one that determines the liquidity amount of each money unit is at the mercy of the side
effect of the monadic autocrat.

\begin{code}
data (Monad autocrat) => AutocraticCommunism autocrat

instance (Monad autocrat) => MoneyDistribution (AutocraticCommunism autocrat)
\end{code}

\lhsparagraph{Communism Bad}

In colcusion, as it has been demonstrated, all forms of communism are not workable as it's either neither functional nor
pure money redistribution mechanism.
