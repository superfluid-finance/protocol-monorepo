        Money, money, money

        Must be funny

        In the rich man's world

        Money, money, money

        Always sunny

        In the rich man's world

        \

        Ah, all the things I could do

        If I had a little money

        It's a rich man's world

It should be fair to say, every aspect of money are controversial: the nature of money, the value of money, money and
banking, and monetary reconstruction. Two major schools of thoughts about theory of money are the \textit{Austrian
    school} (\cite{von2013theory}) and the \textit{Chicago school} (\cite{friedman1989quantity}). That is before the
appearance of Internet-era version of monetary reconstruction, broadly defined as cryptocurrency, which challenges
theories of money further and demands their updates (\cite{ammous2018can} \cite{hardle2020understanding}).

But when it comes to the function of money, it is less controversial. According to Von Mises,

\begin{quotation}
The function of money is to facilitate the business of the market by acting as a common medium of
exchange. \footfullcite[][Chapter One, Chapter I, ยง 1, p1]{von2013theory}
\end{quotation}

How do different forms of money perform this function, especially in the information age, when electronic forms of money
are increasingly used?

This yellow paper adds a new controversy to money, that is to present a survey challenging the preconceived notion of
how money can perform its function of medium of exchange using computer science.

In Chapter I, we shall first explore the foundation for the survey. Here we present a formal definition of payment system,
and various models used in the system. We then select a few relevant approaches used in computer science useful for
modeling and defining formal specification for the payment system.

One of the approaches is \textit{denotational semantics}, which is used in Chapter II of the paper to define the general
payment primitives. Along with the denotational semantics, a restatement\footnote{It is a borrowed term from common law:
"restatement of the law". In our case, the denotative mathematical "laws".} of it in \textit{Haskell programming
    language} (\cite{hudak1992report} \cite{jones2003haskell} \cite{marlow2010haskell}) is also included.

In Chapter III, a reference implementation of the general payment primitives and its payment system called
\textit{Superfluid Money} is introduced.

In Chapter IV, some possible further investigations are included for future study purpose.

\section{Payment System}

We shall define a payment system, whereby:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{money distribution} models how monetary value is distributed amongst bearers\footnote{(Banking \& Finance)
a person who presents a note or bill for payment. - Collins English Dictionary},
\item \textit{payment primitives} updates money distribution,
\item \textit{financial system} provides the execution environment for the payment primitives,
\item and \textit{forms of money medium} are the "user interfaces" of money for the bearers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Money Distribution Models}

Most of the existing money schemes are of this category, where a money unit completely disregards its context and hence
its liquidity value and bearer are static until the next money redistribution occurs.

Here are the type definitions of these money schemes defined in \cite{buldas2021unifying}:

\section{Denotational Semantics}

Here is the specification of denotational semantics that support both discrete and continous payments.

Here is the list of acronyms used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MD} is \textit{Money Distribution}.
    \item \textbf{MU} is \textit{Monetary Unit}.
    \item \textbf{RTB} is \textit{Real Time Balance}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generalized Payment Model}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_transfer}
    \begin{split}
        [\![MD\ mu\ t\ rtb]\!] = mu \rightarrow t \rightarrow rtb
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Monoidial Payment Model}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_mzero}
    [\![\emptyset]\!] = \lambda\ mu\ t\ \rightarrow 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_mappend}
    [\![mda \oplus\ mdb]\!] = \lambda\ mu\ t\ \rightarrow
    [\![mda]\!]\ mu\ t\ +\ [\![mdb]\!]\ mu\ t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Payment Premitives}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_transfer}
    \begin{split}
        [\![&transfer\ from\ to\ amount\ md]\!] = [\![md]\!]\ \oplus \\
        (\lambda\ case&\ mu\ t \\
        &|\ from = mu \rightarrow -amount \\
        &|\ to   = mu \rightarrow amount \\
        &|\ otherwise \rightarrow 0 \\
        )
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_updateConstantFlow}
    \begin{split}
        [\![&updateConstantFlow\ from\ to\ flowRate\ t'\ md]\!] = [\![md]\!]\ \oplus \\
        (\lambda\ case&\ mu\ t \\
        &|\ from = mu \rightarrow -flowRate * (t - t') \\
        &|\ to   = mu \rightarrow flowRate  * (t - t') \\
        &|\ otherwise \rightarrow 0 \\
        )
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    unit :: sub \rightarrow subs \rightarrow Int
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    proportion\ sub\ subs = {{ unit\ sub\ subs } \over { \displaystyle \sum_{x \in subs} unit\ x\ subs }}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_distributeProportionally}
    \begin{split}
        [\![&distributeProportionally\ pub\ subs\ amount\ md]\!] = [\![md]\!]\ \oplus \\
        (\lambda\ case&\ mu\ t \\
        &|\ pub = mu \rightarrow -amount \\
        &|\ \exists sub \in subs\ { sub = mu } \rightarrow amount * (proportion\ mu\ subs) \\
        &|\ otherwise \rightarrow 0 \\
        )
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{sem_distributeProportionally}
    \begin{split}
        [\![&updateProportionalDistributionConstantFlow\ pub\ subs\ flowRate\ t'\ md]\!] = [\![md]\!]\ \oplus \\
        (\lambda\ case&\ mu\ t \\
        &|\ pub = mu \rightarrow -flowRate * (t - t') \\
        &|\ \exists sub \in subs\ { sub = mu } \rightarrow flowRate * (t - t') * (proportion\ mu\ subs) \\
        &|\ otherwise \rightarrow 0 \\
        )
    \end{split}
