## [1.4.3] - 2022-06-30

### Breaking

-   `totalAmountStreamedUntilUpdatedAt` on `AccountTokenSnapshot` and `totalAmountStreamed` on `AccountTokenSnapshotLog` are no longer calculating the total amount streamed out from an account, but the net amount streamed through an account
    -   Migration: replace this with `totalAmountStreamedOutUntilUpdatedAt` and `totalAmountStreamedOut`, respectively

### Fixes

-   GovernanceAddress is no longer hardcoded and subgraph detects new events from newly set governance contracts
-   `token` property added to `BurnedEvent`, `MintedEvent` and `SentEvent`

## [1.4.2] - 2022-06-29

### Added

-   BNB Chain support added

### Changed

-   `maybeCriticalAtTimestamp` is nullable

### Fixes

-   Add back deprecated `rewardAccount` field on `AgreementLiquidatedV2Event` entity (use `rewardAmountReceiver`)

## [1.4.0] - 2022-05-31

### Breaking

-   `rewardAccount` renamed to `rewardAmountReceiver` on `AgreementLiquidatedV2Event` entity

### Fixes

-   Was not properly updating `updatedAtTimestamp` and `updatedAtBlockNumber`
-   Wasn't updating `totalAmountStreamedUntilUpdatedAt` for `TokenStats` whenever it was updated for `AccountTokenSnapshot`

### Changed

-   README updated to remove dead legacy endpoints, new v1/dev endpoints added
-   Subgraph tests use hardhat node, config changed in `hardhat.config.ts`

### Added

-   Script to check if subgraph is deployed on every network
-   `logIndex` and `order` properties added to all `Event` entities
-   `maybeCriticalAtTimestamp` and `isLiquidationEstimateOptimistic` properties added to `AccountTokenSnapshot` entity
-   `AccountTokenSnapshotLog` entity added (created on every update to `AccountTokenSnapshot`)
-   Tests added for new properties/entities
-   Tests fixed up given subgraph logic

## [1.3.4] - 2022-05-16

### Added

-   Avalanche C-Chain network support

## [1.3.3] - 2022-05-13

### Changed

-   Removed tests as they were not catching the [issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/3553)

### Fixes

-   Removed (immutable: true) from `FlowOperatorUpdated` entity - No operators should

## [1.3.2] - 2022-05-11

### Changed

-   Zero address `Account` and `AccountTokenSnapshot` entities are not filtered out

### Fixes

-   Global `events` query fixed: global `events` query was breaking due to the `FlowUpdatedEvent` entity implementing the `Event` interface, but not having the immutable property like the other events
-   `AccountTokenSnapshot` query with `account { id }` fixed. Was breaking due to faulty logic of creating an `AccountTokenSnapshot` without creating an `Account` entity
-   Tests added to ensure this will be caught

## [1.3.1] - 2022-05-06

### Changed

-   Most event entities are immutable (except FlowUpdated)

### Added

-   New Access Control List (ACL) entities and properties added
    -   `FlowOperator` entity
    -   `flowOperator` property
    -   `deposit` and `totalDeposit` properties added to entities

### Fixes

-   Properly handle zero address throughout

## [1.3.0] - 2022-05-04

### Changed

-   Package updates (#550, #604)
-   Subgraph tests use `sdk-core` instead of `js-sdk` and general refactoring (#594, #621)

### Added

-   Subgraph supports new entities: `PPPConfigurationChangedEvent`, `AgreementLiquidatedV2Event` (#558)
-   Added complementary liquidation tests

### Fixed

-   +1 to `getRandomFlowRate` so flowRate is never 0 (#538)

## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-13

### Fixed

### Breaking

### Added

-   Complete set of Superfluid event entities
-   HOL (Higher order level) entities
